WEEKLY CHALLENGE MODULE 5

Criteria: 
The site should have a polished user interface which is responsive to all screen sizes. 

Create a password generator in which the user recieves prompts to decide whether they want their password to have: 
- LENGTH OF PASSWORD: Number of charecters (between 10 to 64)
- CHARECTER TYPE: Lower case letters
- CHARECTER TYPE: Upper case letters
- CHARECTER TYPE: Numeric values
- CHARECTER TYPE: Special characters

The code should validate for each input & at least one character type should be selected. Once prmpts are answered, the password should be generated and written to the page.


STEPS: 
1. The first step is to declare the variables for the different charecter types. the variables should be: 
- special characters
- numeric values
- lower case letters
- upper case letters

2. the second step is to add the prompts within a function using if else statements for the result. 

create a function called USEROPTIONS 
create the first prompt: 
- specify a variable to determine which prompt this is, (password length) & then create a prompt asking the user to enter in a number. 
- create an if else statement specifying what the alert should be if the user enters in a number, or if they enter a number not specified within the criteria.
